# Groceries in a blizzard - Minneapolis, MN

Minneapolis, MN receives a ton of snow every year. 
While most residents will try to remain at home during a snow storm, there will be instances where they need to go out, get in their car, and drive to a nearby grocery store to 
resupply. The goal of this project is to determine the safest route a resident can take to a nearby grocery store in a snow storm.

A full description and running demo of the project can be found at https://groceries-in-a-blizzard.onrender.com/. Note: the free version of the web hosting service is quite slow and
will take a while to run. A local installation will run much faster, but will require an OpenRoute Service API token (https://openrouteservice.org/).

Installation:
Python version 3.10.13 or above
pip install r- requirements.txt

Running:
streamlit run app.py

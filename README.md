# Groceries in a blizzard - Minneapolis, MN

Minneapolis, MN receives a ton of snow every year. 
While most residents will try to remain at home during a snow storm, there will be instances where they need to go out, get in their car, and drive to a nearby grocery store to 
resupply. The goal of this project is to determine the safest route a resident can take to a nearby grocery store in a snow storm.

A full description of the project can be found in app.py. A local installation of this repo will require an OpenRoute Service API token (https://openrouteservice.org/).
